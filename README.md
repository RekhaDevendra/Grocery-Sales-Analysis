# Grocery Sales Analysis Project  
Unlocking Customer Insights and Market Trends  

## Overview  
This project explores grocery store data to uncover valuable insights about customer purchasing behavior, store performance, and product trends. Using machine learning models, advanced analytics, and data visualization techniques, the project delivers actionable insights for strategic decision-making.  

## Key Features  

**Data Preparation**  
- Raw data cleaned and processed for analysis.  
- Scaled data prepared for clustering and regression.  

**Dimensional Modeling**  
- Built a star schema for easier reporting and querying.  

**Market Basket Analysis**  
- Implemented Apriori for frequent itemset mining.  

**Clustering and Regression**  
- Analyzed product performance across stores using K-Means clustering and regression.  

**Classification**  
- Decision tree model to predict customer purchase behaviors.  

**Time Series Analysis**  
- Seasonal and trend analysis for dollar sales and units sold over time.  

**Text Analysis**  
- Created word clouds and extracted meaningful insights from textual data.  

**Visualizations**  
- Visualized key findings with scatter plots, regression lines, word clouds, and dashboards.
